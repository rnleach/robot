# robot
AVR/Arduino based robot code for my kids. They think it is cooler because Dad made it.

## Introduction
I have a few Arduino boards, an [OSEPP Robot kit][1], and a [Starter Kit for Arduino][2]. I plan on mixing and matching 
parts to make a robot and doing all the code in C/C++ without using the Arduino library. I'll be writing all the code, 
but my kids will be helping with the robot and choosing the components that get put onto it.

## Code
Instead of using a bunch of libraries I plan to roll my own C/C++ code for the components so the kids can see how some pretty
simple low level bit fiddling can make the robot work. It may not be as elegant, portable, or robust as some of the libraries,
but it is meant to be simple and demonstrate programming principles like encapsulation.
